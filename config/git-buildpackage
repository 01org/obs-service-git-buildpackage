##
## Configuration for the git-buildpackage OBS source service
##

[general]
## Repository cache directory.
## Default is '/var/cache/obs/git-buildpackage-repos/'
## You probably need to define if the service is run on the client side as
## the default directory is likely not accessible by regular users.
#repo-cache-dir = /var/cache/obs/git-buildpackage-repos/

## User and group
## The user and group under which git-buildpackage is run. The service itself
## is run under whatever user/group the source service server is configured to
## use - this user must have the privileges to set uid/gid if you configure
## these settings. You can give the user and group as name or uid/gid number
##directly.
#gbp-user = gbpservice
#gbp-group = gbpservice
